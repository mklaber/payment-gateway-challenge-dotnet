# Assignment Notes

* I added the overall brief as a submodule using `git submodule add git@github.com:cko-recruitment/.github.git cko-brief`
* Repo provided by CKO is vulnerable to [CVE-2024-21907][cve] via `coverlet.collector`
* Made a decision not to upgrade to .NET 9.0 for now; would rather not find an alternative to Swagger UI
